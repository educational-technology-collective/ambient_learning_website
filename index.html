                        Welcome to our innovative mobile flashcard app, where learning is seamlessly integrated with the
                        power of spaced repetition to maximize students' long-term educational goals. Our app introduces an
                        engaging approach by utilizing spaced repetition, a scientifically proven technique that optimizes
                        memory retention. Through our app, students encounter meticulously crafted flashcards delivered at
                        strategic intervals, ensuring efficient reinforcement of crucial concepts. What sets us apart is our
                        unique methodology – instead of users generating their own flashcards, our app identifies "learning
                        moments" while users engage with course material, both within the app and through our Chrome
                        extension. These pivotal instances trigger the automatic generation of relevant flashcards, which
                        are then seamlessly incorporated into the user's study plan.
                    </p>
    
                    <!-- <p>
                            Moreover, our Chrome extension brings an added dimension to the learning experience by seamlessly interfacing with Coursera's data science courses. As users navigate these courses, the extension discreetly monitors their progress, identifying moments of significance. These moments are transformed into potent flashcards, bolstering the user's understanding of intricate topics. By combining this extension's insights with our app's intelligent spaced repetition, we provide students with an unparalleled toolset to enhance their comprehension and retainment capabilities. With our holistic approach to learning, we're excited to empower students on their educational journey like never before.
